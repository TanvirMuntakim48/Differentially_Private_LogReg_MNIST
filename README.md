# MNIST Classification (6 vs no 6) + Differentially Private Training

In this notebook, I implement logistic regression from scratch on the MNIST Dataset. I add in some extra features like:
* Mini-batch training
* L2 Regularization
* Add gaussian noise each step of training to implement noisy gradient descent to perform Differentially Private Training

N.B: The mnist-original.mat can be downloaded readily from the internet. Not included in the repusitory due to size constraints
